# Train-Booking-System
Train Booking System is a Spring Boot–based backend application that handles ticket booking, PNR generation, validation, dynamic status assignment, database storage using JPA/Hibernate, and REST APIs. The React frontend communicates with these APIs to book tickets, fetch PNR details, and view all bookings.
